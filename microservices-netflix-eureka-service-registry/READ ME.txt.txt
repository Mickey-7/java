Building Spring Boot Microservices
	In this Spring Boot microservice application, we will create three separate Spring Boot applications:

	Eureka Service Registry: This application will enable the Eureka Server by adding annotation @EnableEurekaServer and register every microservice.

	Service 1: This service will generate the simple greeting message from service 1 and will register with the Eureka service registry by adding the annotation @EnableDiscoveryClient.

	Service 2: This service will also generate the simple greeting message from service 2 and will register with the Eureka service registry.


Test the application
	Now everything is all set, itâ€™s time to test all applications. Follow the below steps to test your application.

	1.Start your Eureka Service Registry application i.e Eureka Server first. 
	  Once it loaded hit this http://localhost:8761/ in your web browser.
	2.Now run your client application i.e. Service-1 and Service-1. 
	  It will take a couple of minutes to register with the server.
	3.Refresh the Eureka Server and you can see that both services have been registered.
